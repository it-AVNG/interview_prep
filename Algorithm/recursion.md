# Recursion
Highly used method and heavily rely on.
Complete a work where it is repeated done for a set of
different inputs. The concept of recursion means in a big problem,
the result can be computed from a smaller internal subset result.
Eventually, there will be a univeral accepted result when we reach the smallest
subset. Which is the base case.

## Area of concern:
1. Recursive function: call the next sequence, or input inline to ask for answer
2. Base case: Where we know this is the minimum answer.

When the base case will be reach, we returned the answer back to the preceded call.
The call will compute the returned input and reach answer for a case.
When a case has reached their result, it will return the result back to the preceded call.

Until our call stack is empty.

## Data structure and Algorithm that implement recursion:
1. Tree
2. Graphs
3. Dynamic Programming
4. matrix manipulating
5. sort

Every problem that can be solve recursively, we can implement a stack or iteration.
Remember: Recursion use memory to run.
