# Searching
At many times, we need to find some element in the data structures.
There are 2 main technique:

## Linear search:
Jump one node to another to find the element.
When we dealing with data structure like linked list, queue or stack.
Typically we will deal with linear search technique. Becasue that is
how we access the data.

A Heap is also a type a queue or stack.

## Binary Search:
It is powerfull but it must have: Data is sorted.
principle of binary search:
1. Because the array is sorted, we can divide the set into 2 part
2. Consider which part does our required element is part of
3. repeat until the element is found.
