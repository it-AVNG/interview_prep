A Linked list is not a list. It is made of nodes that has the memory address
of the node next to it.
It is a linear data structure but it is dynamic in nature.

## Single link list

For single link list, to go to an element, we have to sequentially
traverse the list.
from the 1st element.

## Doubly Link List

Each of the node, hold the information of the previous node and the node
that is next in the list.
Which means, a doubly link list has the method to traverse up and down the list.

## Circular link list

The cycle is continuous, is a doubly link list where the last and the first
node pointing to each other.
