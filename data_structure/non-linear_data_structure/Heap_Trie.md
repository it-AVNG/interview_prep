# Advanced Data Struture: Heap

A heap is a Binary Tree type of Data structure but carry with it a priority Queue
We usually use it to keep track of min and max value of data stream.

## A typical heap structure:
### Min Heap:
Create a binary tree where the parent node has the lower value than its children
Which means that, the heap operation will shuffle the value (not the node) when a value
that need to prioritize come first.
