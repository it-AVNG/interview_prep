# None linear data structure: Graphs
A graph has 2 properties: Vertices and Edges.
Agraph can be cyclic in nature.

A Vertex is Node. A graph node can connect to other node and also can connect to itself.
An Edge is the link between 2 vertices. An edge can have defined direction.

## Concept:
+ Adjacency: 2 nodes that has and edge connection to each other, is adjacent to each other.
+ Degree: The number of vertices that a node has.

## Directive graph:

A directed graph is where it edges has direction pointing to other vertices.

## Undirected Graph:
An undirectied graph is where the edge has bidirective connection.

## Weighted edge
A weighted graph is a graph that it takes 'toll' or 'weighted' to travel. It could be a latency time or complexity.

## Cyclic and Acyclic
Cyclic means the graph actually completed a cycle, We can travel all the node of a graph and return to the starting node
with each edge can be travel once.
Acuclic means the graph has open end.
