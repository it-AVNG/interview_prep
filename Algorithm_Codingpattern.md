# Algorithm
From the requirement, we generate a set of procedure
for the program to follow to produce a desired
outcomes.

# Coding Pattern
Depending on problem statement we will generate idea to generate
algorithm. By examine many excercise of similar type to have an idea.

combination and coding pattern implement on data structures is the building
block.
