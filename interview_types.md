# Interview format
3-6 rounds of interview, which is usually breaks down to 3 categories:
++ Behaviourial interview: What kind of person are you, are you able to work well with others?
  ++ Are you able to raise concerns and questions?
  ++ How are you going to handle conflicts?
++ System design interview:
  ++ More stress for senior level, there will be some emphasis for junior level.
  ++ Typical: If you are going to build ... how are you approaching it?, this will dive into the pool of software solution.
++ Technical Interview: 45-60 min interviewer will ask for questions regarding solutions and ask for code solution.

Understanding Datastructure and Algorithm to adapt inorder to solve the problems.
Furthermore, big O analysis worst case Scenarios time and space complexity to understand if a solution is good or not.

# Golden Rule and Rule of Thumb:
1. Anytime dealing with top/max/min/closet 'K' elements among 'N' element, use Heap
2. Sorted Array, Binary search will help with search.
3. Compute a combination or permutation: use Backtracking or BFS
4. When see Trees or Graphs: BFS and DFS is your friend
5. Recursive solution can be subtitute by a stack. Many time a recuresion is long enough, memory could be a problem.
6. Array that can be solve using O(n^2). Try to sort the array first and we can approach with O(nlogn), if we use Hashing O(n)
7. Optimize or find min or max of steps we use dynamic programming approach (coin chain example)
8. Search and manipulation string using TRIE data structure
9. When a linked list with no addition space to store extra computation, use rabbit and hare method.

# Pit fall:
Smart communication and management skill shine through to avoid these pitfall

1. Well prepare and lower the chance of missing out career changing.
2. Listen Carefully to the interviewer. Interviewer will give you the small subset of the question. Ask clarification questions.
3. Always manage your time, an interview will last for 45-60 min. Technical part will ranges between 30-50 min, therer are alot of thing we need to prepare for.
4. Think about the edge cases.
5. Write clean and readable code.
6. Voice your thought, don't let awkward silence ruin your chance.
7. Raise concern and if stuck as for help and assitance. They are there to help you.
9. Know 1 programming language well.
10. Don't be stressed or flustered when a mistake is made.
11. Don't give up, see the most trivial approach and try to build upon that. Be communicative to the interviewer will help you.
12. Always try to optimize.
13. After the interview is done, follow up with a thank you note about 24hours later, and after 3-5 day, send a followup email.
